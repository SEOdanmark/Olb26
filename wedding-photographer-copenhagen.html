<p>Furthermore, sustainability and eco-consciousness have also made their way into photographic styles as couples become more environmentally aware. Many photographers now offer services that emphasize minimal environmental impact practices such as digital albums instead of print versions or using public transport between locations. Engagement shoots prior to the wedding day have also gained popularity in Copenhagen. <br><br>  Lastly, personalization plays an important role in current trends where couples want their individual stories reflected through imagery. Consequently, photographers are spending more time getting to know each couple – understanding their personalities and preferences - so they can tell a unique narrative through visual means. <br><br></p></div>
